# Storage Only Plan - Product Spec

**Feature Owner:** Yoav
**Status:** In Progress — Backend complete, iOS in progress
**Target Launch:** 6 weeks

---

## Executive Summary

A low-cost subscription tier ($2.99/month) for users who want to preserve their videos without actively creating new content. Targets two segments:
1. **Zoog+ churners** - offered during cancellation flow
2. **Free-tier users** - offered before video deletion begins

**Primary Goal:** Validate whether a low-cost storage option reduces hard churn and converts free users.

## Storage Limit Enforcement System (✅ Implemented — PR #363)

### Per-Plan Storage Limits

| Plan | Limit | Config Key |
|------|-------|------------|
| Free | 100 MB | `settings/plans.storageLimits.free` |
| Storage-Only | 100 GB | `settings/plans.storageLimits.storage-only` |
| Premium (Zoog+) | Unlimited | `settings/plans.storageLimits.premium = -1` |

Limits stored in Firestore `settings/plans` document — can be updated without redeploying.

### Recording Status Flow

System-initiated statuses (separate from user-initiated `markedForDeletion` → `deleted`):
```
active → scheduledForDeletion → softDeleted
  ↑            │
  └── revert ──┘  (user upgrades or deletes enough to be under limit)
```

| Status | Visibility | Files on GCS | Recoverable |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `active` | Visible in app | Yes | N/A |
| `scheduledForDeletion` | Visible in app with warning | Yes | Yes — automatic |
| `softDeleted` | Hidden from app | Yes | Yes — automatic on resubscribe |

### Enforcement Model (Event-Driven + Cron Safety Net — PR #385)

Storage limit enforcement is **event-driven**: evaluation happens at the moment of change rather than via brute-force cron sweeps. The cron is retained only for time-based operations and as a safety net.

#### `evaluateUserStorageLimit` HTTP Endpoint

Standalone per-user evaluation endpoint (`POST /evaluateUserStorageLimit`) that:
1. Accepts `{ userId, source, skipAdaptyVerification }` — source for logging, skip flag controls tier resolution method
2. **30-second debounce** via `storageCalculatedAt` timestamp — prevents redundant evaluations on rapid events
3. Calculates **active-only** storage per user (cross-references GCS files with Firestore recording statuses)
4. If over limit: sets grace period, marks oldest recordings as `scheduledForDeletion` until active storage ≤ plan limit
5. If under limit and in grace period: reverts all scheduled deletions, sends relaxing notification
6. Runtime: `timeoutSeconds: 120`, `memory: "512MB"`

#### Event Triggers

| Trigger | Mechanism | skipAdaptyVerification |
|---|---|---|
| Subscription expired/downgraded | Adapty webhook → `evaluateUserStorageLimit` | `false` (calls Adapty API) |
| Subscription access level changed | Adapty webhook (access_level_updated) → `evaluateUserStorageLimit` | `false` |
| Apple subscription expired | Apple webhook → `evaluateUserStorageLimit` | `false` |
| Recording created/status changed | Recordings trigger → `evaluateUserStorageLimit` (fire-and-forget) | `true` (Firestore-only) |

On HTTP call failure, the recordings trigger falls back to setting `storageNeedsRecalc = true` so the cron catches it.

#### Cron (`storageLimitCron`) — Slimmed to Safety Net

Daily cron (Cloud Scheduler, 3am UTC), reduced from scanning all inactive users to only:
1. **Storage-only + premium safety net** — re-verifies tier via Adapty API for subscribed users (catches stale Firestore data)
2. **`storageNeedsRecalc` fallback** — picks up users whose event-driven evaluation failed
3. **Grace period processing** — milestone notifications (days 1, 7, 14, 21, 27, 30) and soft-delete transitions (`scheduledForDeletion` → `softDeleted`)

Runtime reduced from `540s/1GB` to `300s/512MB`.

### Grace Period Model

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `gracePeriodStartDate` | ISO string | When the 30-day countdown began |
| `gracePeriodReason` | string | `"subscription_expired"` or `"storage_limit_exceeded"` |
| `scheduledDeletionDate` | ISO string | On recording docs: `gracePeriodStartDate + 30 days` |
| `storageCalculatedAt` | ISO string | Last evaluation timestamp (30s debounce for event-driven) |
| `storageNeedsRecalc` | boolean | Fallback flag — set when event-driven HTTP call fails, cleared by cron |

### Client API (`getScheduledDeletions`)

Callable function that returns what the app needs to display deletion warnings:
```json
{
  "hasScheduledDeletions": true,
  "deletionDate": "2026-03-18T00:00:00Z",
  "daysLeft": 23,
  "recordings": [
    { "id": "rec123", "thumbnailImage": "...", "updateTime": "...", "duration": 42, "scheduledDeletionDate": "..." }
  ],
  "totalScheduledCount": 12,
  "currentActiveUsage": "48.2 MB",
  "planLimit": "100 MB",
  "planLimitBytes": 104857600,
  "overageBytes": 37600000,
  "tier": "free"
}
```

### Storage Usage API (`getStorageUsage`)

Updated to support all tiers with dynamic limits:
```json
{
  "storageUsedBytes": 121634816,
  "storageUsedGB": 0.11,
  "storageLimitBytes": 104857600,
  "storageLimitGB": 0.10,
  "isOverCap": true,
  "canUpload": false,
  "tier": "free"
}
```

### Recovery

Automatic recovery when subscription becomes active (via Adapty or Apple webhook):
1. All `scheduledForDeletion` and `softDeleted` recordings revert to `active`
2. Grace period fields cleared from user doc
3. Amplitude "Videos Restored" event fired

Also triggers during cron re-evaluation if user manually deletes enough videos to go under limit.

### Subscription Tier Verification (✅ Implemented — PR #369, PR #370)

**Problem:** Adapty webhook events (especially from sandbox) can write stale `accessLevel: "premium"` and `subscriptionActive: true` to Firestore for expired subscriptions. Additionally, Adapty may never send `subscription_expired` webhooks for sandbox auto-renewals — it just stops renewing, so Firestore never learns the sub expired.

**Solution:** Three-layer tier resolution, from most authoritative to fallback:

| Layer | Function | Source | Used By |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1. Adapty API | `getAdaptyVerifiedTier(userId, userData)` | Real-time Adapty API call | `getStorageUsage`, `getScheduledDeletions`, `evaluateUserStorageLimit` (when `skipAdaptyVerification: false`) |
| 2. Firestore expiry check | `getValidatedSubscriptionTier(userData)` | Firestore `subscriptionExpiryDate` | `storageLimitCron` (batch), `evaluateUserStorageLimit` (when `skipAdaptyVerification: true`) |
| 3. Access level only | `getSubscriptionTier(accessLevel)` | Firestore `accessLevel` field | Legacy (kept for backward compat) |

**`getAdaptyVerifiedTier`** (PR #370):
- Calls `GET /api/v1/sdk/profiles/{userId}/` on Adapty API
- Checks `paid_access_levels.premium.is_active` and `paid_access_levels["storage-only"].is_active`
- Falls back to `getValidatedSubscriptionTier` if Adapty API is unreachable (5s timeout)
- Used for user-facing functions where accuracy matters more than latency

**`getValidatedSubscriptionTier`** (PR #369):
- Checks `subscriptionExpiryDate` — if in the past, returns `"free"`
- If no expiry date and `subscriptionActive === false`, returns `"free"`
- Otherwise falls through to `accessLevel` (same as original behavior)
- Used for batch processing where Adapty API rate limits are a concern

---

## Notification System (✅ Implemented — PR #363, unified in PR #374)

All warning notifications are now handled by `storageLimitCron` (the separate `deletionWarningCron` was removed). This ensures milestone warnings run in the same pass as storage enforcement, reducing redundant Firestore queries.

### Warning Sequence

| Day | Action | Channels |
|-----|--------|----------|
| **Day 1** | Videos scheduled, warning begins | Email + Push + In-App |
| **Day 7** | "Your memories need a home" | Email + Push + In-App |
| **Day 14** | "14 days left to save your videos" | Email + Push + In-App |
| **Day 21** | "7 days left" | Email + Push + In-App |
| **Day 27** | "3 days left — FINAL NOTICE" | Email + Push + In-App |
| **Day 30** | Videos soft-deleted | Email + Push + In-App |

### Two Template Sets

| Channel | Cancelled Subscribers | Free Users |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| Email | `deletion-warning-day-{N}` | `storage-limit-warning-day-{N}` |
| Push CTA | Storage-only popup | Upgrade to Zoog+ |
| In-App CTA | Storage-only popup | Manage subscription |

Selection is automatic based on `gracePeriodReason`:
- `"subscription_expired"` → subscriber templates
- `"storage_limit_exceeded"` → free-user templates

### Email Templates (Mandrill)

12 templates total (6 per flow). Each day has a distinct header color that progressively conveys urgency:

| Day | Header Color | Subhead Color |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | `#F1F1F1` (light gray) | `#002349` (dark blue) |
| 7 | `#002349` (dark blue) | `#FFFFFF` (white) |
| 14 | `#ff7051` (orange-red) | `#FFFFFF` (white) |
| 21 | `#ff8500` (orange) | `#FFFFFF` (white) |
| 27 | `#b71c1c` (dark red) | `#FFFFFF` (white) |
| 30 | `#424242` (dark gray) | `#FFFFFF` (white) |

Merge variables: `*|FNAME|*`, `*|VIDEO_COUNT|*`, `*|STORAGE|*`, `*|DAYS_LEFT|*`, `*|DELETION_DATE|*`

### Relaxing Notifications (✅ Implemented — PR #374)

When a user exits grace period (by upgrading or deleting enough videos), a "relaxing" notification reassures them:

| Reason | Title | Subtitle | Thumbnail | Tap Action |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| `upgrade` | "Your Zoogs are now safe" | "You now have {tierLabel} storage — your videos are no longer scheduled for deletion." | `Hearts_popup2_sw1ue9.png` | None |
| `deleted_videos` | "Your Zoogs are no longer scheduled for deletion" | "You're back within your storage limit. Consider upgrading to Zoog+ for more space." | `Potion.png` | Manage Subscription |

**Trigger points:**
- `storageLimitCron` — when cron detects user is now under limit or on unlimited tier
- Adapty webhook (`getSubscriptionInfo`) — on `subscription_updated` and `access_level_updated` when user was in grace period
- Apple webhook (`appleWebHook`) — when user resubscribes via App Store

**Helper functions (in `shared.js`):**
- `sendPushAndInApp(userId, { title, subtitle, thumbnailImage, tapAction, info })` — generic FCM + in-app notification helper
- `sendRelaxingNotification(userId, reason, tierLabel)` — sends the relaxing push/in-app and fires "Relaxing Notification Sent" Amplitude event

## Appendix A: Storage Analysis (Actual Data)

*Data collected: January 2026 via GCS bucket scan of `recordings_storage_prod`*

### Current Storage Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total users with recordings | 185,492 |
| Total files | 4,006,827 |
| Total storage | 32.46 TB |
| **Average per user** | **183 MB** |
| **Median per user** | **43 MB** |
| 90th percentile | 418 MB |
| 95th percentile | 795 MB |
| 99th percentile | 2.23 GB |

### Storage Distribution

| Tier | Users | % |
|------|-------|---|
| Under 100 MB | 126,746 | 68.3% |
| 100-500 MB | 43,246 | 23.3% |
| 500 MB - 1 GB | 8,812 | 4.8% |
| 1-10 GB | 6,653 | 3.6% |
| 10-50 GB | 35 | 0.0% |
| 50-100 GB | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Over 100 GB** | **0** | **0.0%** |

### Top Users by Storage

| Rank | User ID | Storage |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | UUyPhm7FUBYBKk7bujK2... | 33.3 GB |
| 2 | v3Y9zd2XNDX92oGLwuRR... | 24.5 GB |
| 3 | hb9NSsJTJKYu1tDuXZAe... | 22.8 GB |

**Note:** No users currently exceed 50GB. The 100GB cap provides significant headroom.

## Appendix B: Cost Analysis

### Current Cost Structure (540p videos)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| GCS Standard Storage | $0.02/GB/month |
| Total monthly GCS cost | $664.73 |
| **Avg user cost** | **$0.0036/month** |
| Storage Plan price | $2.99/month |
| **Margin per user** | **$2.99 (99.9%)** |
| Break-even storage | 150 GB |

### Projected Cost Structure (1080p videos)

*Video resolution upgrading from 540x960 to 1080x1920 (~4x file size)*

| Metric | Current (540p) | Projected (1080p) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Avg per user | 183 MB | **732 MB** |
| Median per user | 43 MB | **172 MB** |
| Avg user GCS cost | $0.0036/mo | **$0.015/mo** |
| Margin per user | $2.99 | **$2.97** |

### 100GB Cap Rationale

The 100GB cap is justified because:
1. **Current:** No users exceed 50GB; top user is 33GB
2. **With 1080p:** Top users may reach 50-100GB over time
3. **Provides headroom:** Accounts for 4x growth from HD upgrade
4. **Marketing value:** "100GB" sounds generous to users
5. **Unit economics:** Even at 100GB, cost is $2.00 vs $2.99 revenue
